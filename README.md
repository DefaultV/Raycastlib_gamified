# Raycastlib gamification
## Based on the raycastlib made by Miloslav Číž

This repository serves for my own fascination with raycasting with subjective modifications.<br>
Original author of the raycasting library used in this project, the "raycastlib.h" is purely coded by Miloslav Číž @ https://gitlab.com/drummyfish
